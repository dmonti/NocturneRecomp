# rexmod.cmake - shared CMake helper for mods_src/* code mods.

# Include this (after project()) from a mod's own CMakeLists.txt, then call
# rexmod_add_plugin() instead of add_library(). Keeps every mod's build
# config (C++ standard, rex::runtime link, toolchain expectations) consistent
# with scripts/build.py's own settings, since a mod DLL must be ABI-compatible
# with the exe it loads into.
