// of re-deriving (or copy-pasting) the same reverse-engineered constants.
//
// Registers every known address in OnCreateDialogs (dispatched before
// OnModuleLaunched, and before any consumer's own OnCreateDialogs runs a
// lazy lookup) via rex::system::ModRegistry, reached through
// ctx->runtime->mod_registry(). Consumers add `requires = "game_symbols"` to
// their own mod.toml (see mods_src/ui_color/mod.toml) so the SDK guarantees
// this mod is enabled and ordered first, instead of relying on convention.

// +0x74 was originally labeled "rooms" because it happened to read 57 (the

// session via mods_src/player_stats's edit mode: writing to +0x74 did NOT
// move the on-screen ROOMS counter at all, but instead caused STR/CON/INT/
// LCK to jump around (+5 at one value, reset to 0 two values later, +1 two
// values after that) -- behavior consistent with indexing into some
// stat-growth/level table (plausibly the *real* level value that drives
// stat computation, as opposed to +0x48 above which may just be a display
// cache), not a simple incrementing room counter. Do NOT treat +0x74 as
// "rooms" or write to it from a mod until it's properly re-identified --

// session -- everything else, including the unidentified/duplicate fields,
// matched). The delta from the vanilla address (0x240) is exactly the same

// live: held steady at 59 across a 5-second gap with no room change (ruling
// out a free-running frame/tick counter that would coincidentally pass the
