# Extracted game data reference

Facts about how this game's text/data is packaged, encoded, and laid out
in memory, gathered while extracting enemy/item names and investigating
sprite compression. For the general modding mechanism (not specific to
this data), see `docs/making-mods.md`'s "Patching static game text/data"
section.

## `default.xex` packaging

`assets/default.xex` is a standard retail **XEX2** container: AES-128
encrypted (`encryption_type=1`/NORMAL) and "basic" compressed
(`compression_type=1`/BASIC — a simple data/zero-run block scheme, not
LZX). None of this is project-specific obfuscation; it's documented
Xbox 360 packaging.

- Base header (`data[0:24]`, big-endian): magic `XEX2`, module_flags,
  `header_size` (@0x8 — offset where the PE/exe body starts),
  `security_offset` (@0x10), `header_count` (@0x14), then `header_count`
  × 8-byte `(key, value)` optional-header entries.
- Optional header `0x000003FF` (`XEX_HEADER_FILE_FORMAT_INFO`) points at
  `{ info_size:u32, encryption_type:u16, compression_type:u16 }`.
- `xex2_security_info.aes_key` is at file offset `security_offset +
  0x150`: the title's AES key, itself encrypted with the Xbox 360 retail
  common key (`20B185A59D28FDC340583FBB0896BF91` — public across the
  Xbox 360 homebrew/emulation ecosystem; also embedded in this project's
  own `rexglue-sdk/src/system/xex_module.cpp` as `xe_xex2_retail_key`,
  since the SDK performs this same decryption at runtime). One AES-ECB
  block decrypt of that 16-byte key with the retail key gives the
  session key.
- BASIC compression is a list of `(data_size, zero_size)` blocks
  immediately after the 8-byte file-format-info header
  (`(info_size-8)/8` of them): AES-128-CBC-decrypt (zero IV) the
  concatenation of all `data_size` regions as one continuous stream,
  then re-inflate by inserting `zero_size` zero bytes after each chunk.
  This title has 2 blocks: `(15007744, 3702784)` and `(196608, 0)`.
- No signature/hash check runs on this load path (RSA signature
  verification only happens for `.xexp` *patch* application, not the
  base image load) — only a PE MZ/NT header sanity check.
- `XexModule::ReadImage` also supports `encryption_type=0`
  (`XEX_ENCRYPTION_NONE`) + `compression_type=0`
  (`XEX_COMPRESSION_NONE`), which just `memcpy`s the file body directly
  — a fully valid, unencrypted/uncompressed XEX2 file loads with no
  further changes needed.
- The game additionally applies `assets/default.xexp` (a title-update
  delta patch) over the base image on every launch (startup log:
  `XEX patch applied successfully: base version: 0.0.1.4, new version:
  0.0.2.4`). This shifts guest addresses in the string-table region
  (below) by a **constant `+0x30` (48 bytes)** relative to what an
  offline decrypt of the unpatched base file would compute — confirmed
  for two known-good addresses, not proven constant everywhere. **Always
  verify a computed address against a live, running process
  (`scripts/re/scan_guest_memory.py`) rather than trusting offline
  file-offset arithmetic alone.**

Scripts: `scripts/re/dump_xex_image.py` (decrypt+decompress to plain
bytes), `scripts/re/rebuild_xex_unencrypted.py` (decrypt, optionally
patch strings in place, re-emit as an unencrypted/uncompressed XEX2
file).

## String/name table encoding

Item and enemy name fields use a **"big first letter" font encoding**:
the first character of each name is stored as `ASCII_uppercase - 0x20`
(e.g. `'D'` `0x44` → `0x24`, `'M'` `0x4D` → `0x2D`, `'P'` `0x50` → `0x30`);
remaining characters are **plain, uppercase-only ASCII** (no lowercase, no
digits observed to render correctly — the font's glyph set for this
context appears restricted to A-Z). Description/flavor-text fields are
plain ASCII throughout, no special first-letter encoding.

Records in the item tables are `[DESCRIPTION][NAME]`, description first:
proven by the English table's two starter items, where
`"Resembles family sword"` immediately precedes `ALUCART SWORD` and
`"Resembles family shield"` immediately precedes `ALUCART SHIELD`.

Multi-word names are stored as separate consecutive fields, each with its
own big-first-letter encoding (e.g. `AXE` + `KNIGHT`, `AXE` re-encoded as
`!XE`).

Field termination is **not consistent** and must be measured per field,
not assumed:
- Most fields end in a single `0x00` before the next field/entry starts.
- Some fields (seen on both name and description fields) are followed
  directly by `0xFF` with no `0x00` at all.
- Some are followed by more than one `0x00`.
- `0xFF` marks a full entry's end in some records but is not present
  between every field — it is not a reliable universal delimiter on its
  own.
- Two control-byte sequences decode to punctuation in description text:
  `0x81` alone → `'`; `0x81 0x69` / `0x81 0x6a` → `(` / `)`. Other
  non-ASCII control bytes (used for accented characters — à, è, ì, ò, ù,
  ¿, ¡, ü, ß, etc.) are not decoded; extracted description text with
  those characters will show gaps/artifacts.

## Enemy name table

- English enemy names: guest `0x292205df8`–`0x292206534` (host addresses
  from a live scan; subtract the run's `virtual_membase`, commonly but
  not guaranteed to be `0x100000000`, for the true guest address). Flat
  stream of big-font-encoded word tokens, one or more words per enemy
  name, no explicit array/length prefix.
- Enemy bestiary flavor text (separate table, not positionally linked to
  the name table — they are ~57 KB apart with the entire item name table
  between them): guest `0x292214d28`–`0x29221612c`. Plain ASCII.
- Files: `enemy_names_raw.txt` (token stream with addresses),
  `enemy_names_combined.txt` (tokens grouped into full names — some
  multi-word groupings marked `(?)`, unconfirmed), `enemy_descriptions.txt`
  (flavor text with addresses).
- Cross-referenced against `sotn.dev/debug.html` and
  `drrak.github.io/sotn/` (community PS1 reverse-engineering references);
  names matched in both.

## Item name table

Five per-language blocks, back to back, each `~0x1b00`–`0x1c00` bytes:
German, Italian, Spanish, French, English, in that order. A Japanese
(Shift-JIS) block precedes German; not decoded (would need its own
decoder for the multi-byte encoding combined with the control-byte
scheme above).

Address ranges (guest, host-scan-derived as above):
- DE: `0x292208958`–`0x29220a4fc`
- IT: `0x29220a4fc`–`0x29220c044`
- ES: `0x29220c044`–`0x29220dcfc`
- FR: `0x29220dcfc`–`0x29220fad0`
- EN: `0x29220fad0`–`0x292211572` (last entry: Empty Hand)

Files: `item_names_en.txt`, `item_names_de.txt`, `item_names_it.txt`,
`item_names_es.txt`, `item_names_fr.txt` — one paired `NAME`/`DESC` per
line, in memory order, with the description's guest address.

Known decoding gaps:
- Some entries absorb more than one sentence into `DESC` where an item's
  description spans multiple `0x00`-terminated sub-strings with no
  intervening name token — the pairing algorithm attributes all of them
  to the next name found, which is not always the intended grouping.
- Accented characters are not decoded (see encoding section above).

## Sprite graphics compression (PS1 format)

This port's "Original" graphics mode uses the same custom
sprite-compression bitstream as the original PS1 build (distinct from the
"Enhanced" HD textures in `assets/MEDIA/sprites.xpr`, a plain XPR2
resource of pre-converted `TX2D` GPU textures — not this format).
Confirmed by an exact byte-for-byte match of a decoder error-path string,
`"over:%08x(%04x)"`, between the community's independent PS1
reverse-engineering project (`https://github.com/Xeeynamo/sotn-decomp`)
and this build's own decrypted `default.xex` (at the guest-relative
offset matching `0x292206534` in the enemy-name-table addressing above).

Algorithm: a custom nibble-oriented (4-bit-unit) RLE scheme. Each
compressed block starts with an 8-byte cache of recently-seen values,
then the stream is read one nibble at a time as a 4-bit opcode selecting
one of: a zero-run, 1-3 literal nibbles, a repeated nibble N times, a
replay of one of the 8 cached values, or a stop code. Output is always
exactly 8 KB (`0x2000` bytes) per block.

**Location of the compressed data in this build is not confirmed.**
sotn-decomp's own extraction tool expects a PS1-address-space ("stage
header") pointer structure (literal `0x8xxxxxxx` PS1 RAM pointers) that
has no reason to survive in this Xbox 360 port's independently re-linked
binary (`0x82xxxxxx` address space), even though the bitstream format
itself carried over unchanged. A heuristic entropy-based search (looking
for contiguous high-entropy regions, then trying the decoder against
candidate offsets within them) did not find it: every clean decode
produced was confirmed (by rendering under several pixel-format
guesses) to be non-image noise, not real sprite data. "Decodes cleanly"
is not a strong enough signal on its own — this opcode set is permissive
enough that high-entropy non-sprite data can decode to completion
without erroring. The compressed sprite data's real location (if present
in this build at all, as opposed to the "Original" mode being a
rendering style over the same HD texture data) remains unlocated.
Resolving this would need the actual pointer/table structure this port
uses in place of the PS1 stage header, not heuristic scanning.

## Modding these tables

Two mechanisms, detailed in `docs/making-mods.md`'s "Patching static game
text/data" section:

1. Ship a replacement `default.xex` via `mods/<name>/game/default.xex`
   (`scripts/re/rebuild_xex_unencrypted.py` builds one). Whole-file
   replacement, no merge — only one such mod can be active at a time.
2. Patch guest memory from a code mod at `OnModuleLaunched()`, via the
   shared helper in `mods_src/common/include/rexmod/text_patch.h`
   (`ApplyTextPatch` for description fields, `ApplyNameFieldPatch` for
   name fields — the latter applies the big-first-letter encoding
   automatically). Any number of mods can coexist as long as they target
   different addresses. Requires: the guest address confirmed against a
   live process (not offline file-offset math, per the `+0x30`
   title-update-patch note above); the target field's read-only page
   unlocked before writing (`BaseHeap::Protect`); the field length
   measured from what actually follows the string in memory, not assumed
   from `len(text) + 1`.

Example mods: `mods_src/xex_patch_potion` (patches the English "Potion"
item description), `mods_src/xex_patch_red_rust` (patches the English
"Red Rust" item name, both word-fields).
